# ATrack
ATrack is a tracking correction program which uses the results of plate solves to adjust the tracking rates on astrophotography mounts. 

ATrack was created by Craig Young.

It is written Lazarus IDE and Free Pascal. 

It depends on a number of free pascal libraries, which Lazarus can include automatically via Project Inspector. 

It utilizes ASCOM and Visual PinPoint for plate solves.
